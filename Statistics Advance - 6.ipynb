    "#### Handling missing data in a repeated measures ANOVA requires careful consideration, as different methods can lead to varied results. Here's how you might handle missing data and the potential consequences:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Handling Missing Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Complete Case Analysis (CCA): Exclude cases with missing data. This is straightforward but may lead to biased results if missingness is related to the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Mean Imputation: Replace missing values with the mean of the observed values for that variable. While simple, it can underestimate variability and distort relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Interpolation: Predict missing values based on observed values using linear interpolation or other methods. This assumes a certain pattern of change and may introduce bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Multiple Imputation: Generate multiple datasets with imputed values, considering the uncertainty of missing data. Analyze each dataset separately and combine results. This accounts for variability due to imputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Potential Consequences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Bias: Complete Case Analysis may introduce bias if missingness is not random. Mean imputation tends to underestimate variability, leading to biased standard errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Loss of Power: Deleting cases with missing data reduces sample size, reducing statistical power and making it harder to detect true effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Invalid Inferences: Using inappropriate imputation methods may lead to invalid inferences. For example, assuming missing data follow a certain pattern when they don't can introduce bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. False Precision: Mean imputation can make results seem more precise than they are, as it doesn't account for uncertainty in imputed values.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Model Misspecification: Imputing missing values without considering the structure of the data may lead to misspecification of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Best Practices:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Choose the method based on the nature of missingness and the assumptions you are willing to make.\n",
    "* Consider using multiple imputation for a more robust analysis.\n",
    "* Clearly document the method used and any assumptions made.\n",
    "* Perform sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of missing data handling on results.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### In summary, the choice of how to handle missing data in repeated measures ANOVA should be made carefully, considering the potential biases and impact on the validity of results. Multiple imputation is often a preferred method when possible, but it requires careful consideration of the underlying assumptions."

    "### Q12. A researcher wants to know if there are any significant differences in the average daily sales of three retail stores: Store A, Store B, and Store C. They randomly select 30 days and record the sales for each store on those days. Conduct a repeated measures ANOVA using Python to determine if there are any significant differences in sales between the three stores. If the results are significant, follow up with a post- hoc test to determine which store(s) differ significantly from each other."
